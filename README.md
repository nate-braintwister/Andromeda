# Andromeda - A WordPress Theme for Endeese Creative

#### A Little Story About This Theme
This is the first live WordPress theme used by my company Endeese Creative.
It was originally created as something quick that can go live while I worked on something more complex
and creative. Unfortunately, I ended up making a big mistake as there was no original plan, the design
and functionality kept evolving and took way more time and effort than originally planned. In fact, this
wasn't even the original original design as I wasn't happy with a few renditions so I would rip everything
out and start again.

The final product was something I was proud of, admittedly. But this was definitely a lesson learned.

During this time I neglected Github and Bitbucket (I was using that for a while as they have free private repos).
Everything WordPress related was kept on my local drive, and I was unfortunately using a Windows dev environment.
One day, after a crippling Windows 10 update had gotten corrupted, I had to reinstall Windows.
My WordPress development had taken a back seat while I worked on my MEAN and MERN projects. So I had
forgotten about where they were stored.

Long story short: I wiped everything. All that was left was the copy of my theme on my server -- no Sass
files. No dev directory at all.

Again, lesson learned. And that's why I am now back to using Github again.
